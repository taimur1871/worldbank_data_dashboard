# Worldbank Data Dashboard

## Introduction
This is a demo app meant to get population related data from World Bank Website and display it as a table. It can be refactored or expanded to include other available databases. It is also possible to add data visualizations to this app.

The idea is to build a framework which can then be easily used by anyone to build simple data apps.
